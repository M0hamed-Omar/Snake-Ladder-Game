## Project Overview
This project is a C++ application built to simulate a board game with cards, ladders, and snakes. It uses a custom graphics library (CMUgraphics) for the graphical interface and provides a set of features for designing and playing the game.

## Features
- Add and edit cards, ladders, and snakes on a grid.
- Switch between design mode and play mode.
- Save and load game grids.
- Roll dice and move players across the board.
- Implement special attacks and custom card actions.

## Dependencies
- **C++ Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio is recommended (solution files provided).
- **Graphics Library**: CMUgraphics library included in the project.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <>
   ```
2. Open the `PT-Project.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project to compile the source code and link dependencies.
